PDES-A: Parallel Discrete Event Simulation Accelerator
=======================================================

This is an attempt to build a PDES simulation accelerator using the Convey Wolverine Coprocessor.

A basic implementation of the accelerator have been built using verilog. This project, at this stage, is an exploration to understand if Chisel would be beneficial in extending the previous simulator.

More would be added as the project develops.
